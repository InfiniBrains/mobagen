# Philosophy

1. Webassembly is the future. The initial plan is to create a Game Editor and Engine to run on browsers or wrap it in apps such as electron, wasm3 or any other;
2. The engine core should be written in C++;
3. Scripts in JS, TS or WASM, or any language via specialized module;
4. The core should be as small as possible and the modules should be as swappable as possible;
5. Modules are the way to customize and extend the engine. We should create modules to do specific tasks and glue them all together. Ex.: rendering module, physics module, audio module, etc;
6. A build is simply the combination of: a engine player, packed with the modules used, plugins and the assets;
7. The engine should be able to run on any platform, but the editor should be web-first;
8. The company will receive funds from the community to pay the developers and the servers to host the editor. The core will be open source and free to use;
9. The company will offer subscription model to have access to version control and remote build;
10. The company will also offer a marketplace to sell assets, plugins and modules.

# Try online

Before checking it online, some demos are intended to be implemented by you. So most of the demos would look like empty;

- [Empty demos](https://infinibrains.github.io/mobagen/).
- [Flocking demo](https://infinibrains.com/data/flocking) for [this AI class](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OBEY-tb_ubgoq6Mk9lEsCFaYLINni3oPwjH8iAXEQQM/edit?usp=sharing).

# Motivation
- Act as a central point to teach basic game dev concepts;
- Build a regional community around game dev to bring attention to our people;
- Have full control of all the processes from code to the delivery;

# Why C++
- Has many solid, well maintained, efficient and stable libs;
- It speaks straight to hardware, you can do whatever you want;
- It is portable.

# Why CMAKE
It is the best all-around solution to:
- Create projects cross-platform
- Configure variables and flags
- Build complex projects in easy way
- Most relevant libs supports it 

# Why CPM
- Best package manager to import and use third party libs from source code with low maintenance code.

# Architecture
- Please refer to [this doc.](documentation/Architecture.md)
- [C++ core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)

# Restrictions
- Don't recreate all game engine stuff, glue them all. "Life is too short to build a game engine from scratch";
- If a library do not easily compile on all supported platforms, we won't use it.
- Use consolidated libs and do not reinvent the wheel (only if is strictly needed)
- Start small and make small steps towards the goal.
- Always make everything lib interaction swappable as good as we can.
- Never use any lib on the core code. The core should interact with the libs through a glue code. Ex.: core lib -> physics module -> bullet physics engine
- Target the latest C++ version that is portable to our targets(iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, OSX, WEB). [compiler support table](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support).
- CI should be able to build to all targets at once.
