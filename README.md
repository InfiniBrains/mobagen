## Branches
We publish source for the engine in three rolling branches:

The **[master branch](https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen/tree/master)** tracks [live changes](https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen/commits/master) by our engine team. 
This is the cutting edge and may be buggy - it may not even compile. Battle-hardened developers eager to work lock-step with us on the latest and greatest should head here.

The **[release branch](https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen/tree/release)** is extensively tested by our QA team and makes a great starting point for learning the engine or making your own games. We work hard to make releases stable and reliable, and aim to publish new releases every few months.

The **_feature_ branch** where _feature_ is the name of a given feature being developed. When it is done, it will merge its differences into the **[master branch](https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen/tree/master)**.

Other short-lived branches may pop-up from time to time as we stabilize new releases or hotfixes.
