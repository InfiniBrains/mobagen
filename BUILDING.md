# Preparation

## OSX
If you don't have XCode:
- Install it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10335747/how-to-download-xcode-dmg-or-xip-file);
- Install *command line tools* via terminal or follow this [tutorial](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/):
```bash
xcode-select --install
``` 

OSX already has *git*, but if it doesn't, try install it using *brew*. To install brew, type this in terminal:
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install git
```

## Linux
You will need to install *git*, *build-essentials* and *cmake* using your package manager. 

### Ubuntu
``` bash
sudo apt-get install git cmake clang build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev
```

## Windows
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) as IDE and Compiler;
- [CMake addon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools) as CMake tool helper;
- [JetBrains Resharper C++](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper-cpp/) to follow our coding style.

### Windows MinGW Compiler + CLion Editor (Recommended) 
- Installing the compiler:
1. [Install MSYS2_64bits](https://www.msys2.org/) 
This will install 3 subsystems:
`C:\msys64\msys2.exe`, `C:\msys64\mingw32.exe` and `C:\msys64\mingw64.exe`. This will cover only the `MingGW64` methods
2. Run in MSYS2 MinGW64: 
```
pacman -Syu
```
The first time it will update the MSYS2 system
```
pacman -Syu
```
This second time it will update the apps.
3. Install the compiler and other dev stuff
```
pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain git subversion mercurial mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
```
4. Add to your "Path" into Windows "Envrionment Variables" (just type it on Windows Start)
```
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
```

- Installing the Editor:
1. Donwload and install [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). I use the academic license as a professor, you can try using 30-day trial or as student.
2. Configure Toolchain. File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> ToolChains -> Add
- Environment -> `MinGW`
- CMake -> `Bundled`
- Make -> `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\mingw32-make`
- C Compiler -> `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\gcc`
- C++ Compiler -> `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\g++`

# Clonning
In every platform already preparated you must have `git` installed, so open your terminal and type:
```
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen.git
``` 
This will clone the repo and all submodules.

# Building
If you are platform agnostic, you can use CLion: 

## CLion 
- [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- Toolchain will be automatically set on Linux, OSX and Windows(you must install the Visual Studio 2017 toolchain first, or MSYS2).

# Usage
First clone repo with the following command to download all submodules (which are located in the dependencies folder):
`git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen.git`

All builds require cmake 3.6.0, so the first step is to download that [here](https://cmake.org/download/)

## Windows Build
1. Run the cmake gui and point it to this projects folder, configure and then generate a project using whatever toolchain you want. Tested with visual studio 2017
2. Build the project

or

You can use `CMake addon` with `Visual Studio` to open the project, and build it.

## Mac/Linux Build
Run:
```bash
./scripts/cmake-make.sh -j8
```

Then run with:
```bash
./bin/bin/game
```

This will run the first build for you! After that if you need to rebuild do the following:
```bash
cd bin
make -j8
```

## HTML 5 WebGL engine Build
To build the HTML5 engine on OSX or Ubuntu:

Then build the engine:
```bash
./scripts/emscripten-build.sh -j8
```

Then serve it on OSX:
```bash
cd bin-emscripten/bin
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
open http://localhost:8000/
```

If you make a change you can rebuild with the following command:
```bash
cd bin-emscripten/
make -j8
```

## Android Build
To build for android do the following:

First download the android ndk and sdk (https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/) and (https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Then add the SDK and NDK to your path:

e.g. (you can add this to your .bash_profile for convenience)

```bash
export ANDROID_SDK=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/
export ANDROID_NDK=$HOME/workspace/android-ndk-r12b

export PATH="$ANDROID_NDK:$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools:$PATH"
```

Then to build (connect phone in dev mode to computer if you want it to install and run):
```
./scripts/cmake-android.sh -j8
```

To rebuild do the following:
```bash
cd bin-android
make -j8
make android-build android-install android-start
```

If you want to view the backtrace (to see logs and errors do the following):
```bash
cd bin-android
make android-backtrace
```

### To Use:

To use the engine in a game build the engine library and include Engine.h in your game.

View the example in `./src/example/main.cpp`

Or a simple case:

Eg:

```c++
#include "Engine.h"

class CoolGame : public Game
{
public:
  virtual void init(void);
};

void CoolGame::init(void)
{
  auto test_entity = std::make_shared<Entity>();
  test_entity->addComponent<MeshRenderer>(std::make_shared<Mesh>(Asset("../assets/monkey3.obj")), std::make_shared<Texture>(Asset("../assets/t.jpg")));
  addToScene(test_entity);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  CoolGame game;
  Engine gm(&game);

  gm.start();

  return 0;
}
```
