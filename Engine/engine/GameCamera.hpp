//  allCamerasCount	The number of cameras in the current scene.
//  current	The camera we are currently rendering with, for low-level render control only (Read Only).

//  onPostRender	Event that is fired after any camera finishes rendering.
//  onPreCull	Event that is fired before any camera starts culling.
//  onPreRender	Event that is fired before any camera starts rendering.

//  areVRStereoViewMatricesWithinSingleCullTolerance	Determines whether the stereo view matrices are suitable to allow for a single pass cull.
//  aspect	The aspect ratio (width divided by height).
//  backgroundColor	The color with which the screen will be cleared.
//  cameraToWorldMatrix	Matrix that transforms from camera space to world space (Read Only).
//  cameraType	Identifies what kind of camera this is.
//  clearFlags	How the camera clears the background.
//  clearStencilAfterLightingPass	Should the camera clear the stencil buffer after the deferred light pass?
//  commandBufferCount	Number of command buffers set up on this camera (Read Only).
//  cullingMask	This is used to render parts of the scene selectively.
//  cullingMatrix	Sets a custom matrix for the camera to use for all culling queries.
//  depth	Camera's depth in the camera rendering order.
//  depthTextureMode	How and if camera generates a depth texture.
//  eventMask	Mask to select which layers can trigger events on the camera.
//  farClipPlane	The far clipping plane distance.
//  fieldOfView	The field of view of the camera in degrees.
//  forceIntoRenderTexture	Should camera rendering be forced into a RenderTexture.
//  layerCullDistances	Per-layer culling distances.
//  layerCullSpherical	How to perform per-layer culling for a Camera.
//  nearClipPlane	The near clipping plane distance.
//  nonJitteredProjectionMatrix	Get or set the raw projection matrix with no camera offset (no jittering).
//  opaqueSortMode	Opaque object sorting mode.
//  orthographic	Is the camera orthographic (true) or perspective (false)?
//  orthographicSize	Camera's half-size when in orthographic mode.
//  pixelHeight	How tall is the camera in pixels (not accounting for dynamic resolution scaling) (Read Only).
//  pixelRect	Where on the screen is the camera rendered in pixel coordinates.
//  pixelWidth	How wide is the camera in pixels (not accounting for dynamic resolution scaling) (Read Only).
//  previousViewProjectionMatrix	Get the view projection matrix used on the last frame.
//  projectionMatrix	Set a custom projection matrix.
//  rect	Where on the screen is the camera rendered in normalized coordinates.
//  renderingPath	The rendering path that should be used, if possible.
//  scaledPixelHeight	How tall is the camera in pixels (accounting for dynamic resolution scaling) (Read Only).
//  scaledPixelWidth	How wide is the camera in pixels (accounting for dynamic resolution scaling) (Read Only).
//  scene	If not null, the camera will only render the contents of the specified scene.
//  stereoActiveEye	Returns the eye that is currently rendering. If called when stereo is not enabled it will return Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Mono. If called during a camera rendering callback such as OnRenderImage it will return the currently rendering eye. If called outside of a rendering callback and stereo is enabled, it will return the default eye which is Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left.
//  stereoConvergence	Distance to a point where virtual eyes converge.
//  stereoEnabled	Stereoscopic rendering.
//  stereoSeparation	The distance between the virtual eyes. Use this to query or set the current eye separation. Note that most VR devices provide this value, in which case setting the value will have no effect.
//  stereoTargetEye	Defines which eye of a VR display the Camera renders into.
//  targetDisplay	Set the target display for this Camera.
//  targetTexture	Destination render texture.
//  transparencySortAxis	An axis that describes the direction along which the distances of objects are measured for the purpose of sorting.
//  transparencySortMode	Transparent object sorting mode.
//  useJitteredProjectionMatrixForTransparentRendering	Should the jittered matrix be used for transparency rendering?
//  useOcclusionCulling	Whether or not the Camera will use occlusion culling during rendering.
//  velocity	Get the world-space speed of the camera (Read Only).
//  worldToCameraMatrix	Matrix that transforms from world to camera space.
